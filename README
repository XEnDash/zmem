A simple memory allocator for studying purposed, inspired by DOOM's zone memory alloactor

Each allocation has a 24 byte header before the pointer that is a block in a circular linked list
If a block is tagged with "ZMEM_TAG_CACHE" it will be freed when an allocation doesn't find enough contiguous memory

In the future calls to free will coalesce adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation

To compile you need to have the Visual Studio installation directory of the C compiler ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio X.0\VC") in the PATH environemnt variable.
Or just modify the build.bat file to call the full path
